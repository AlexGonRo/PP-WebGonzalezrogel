# My personal website

My personal website. Nothing more to add.

## TODO
I won't necesarily implement all of these, but I leave every nitpick I come up with here.

* I want the main picture a bit smaller when fullscreen...
* Use local .css and .js files if cdn fails.
* Check my licensing again
  * Do I need to mention icomoon somewhere?
  * What about my other css and js?
* Remove JQuery all together at some point. 
* I don't like that the header of the blog is quite different to mine...
* Use a mailing library instead of the mail() function. (Like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer)
* Add internacionalization to main page
* For the go-to-top arrow I had to add the font-awesome icons...a bit of an overkill...
* The go-to-top button is not super responsive, it's not exactly the same I use in the blog either.
* The Linkedin and GitHub buttons at the navbar could be a bit more responsive...
* I would like to revisit the "Send form" functionality. Just to make sure it makes everything I want it to do and create nice error messages.
