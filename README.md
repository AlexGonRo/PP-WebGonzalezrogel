# My personal website
Nothing more to add.

## TODO
I won't necesarily implement all of these, but I leave every nitpick I come up with here.

* Check grammar
* I want the main picture a bit smaller when fullscreen...
* Use local .css and .js files if cdn fails.
* The "Download CV" does not work
* There is no blog
* Check my licensing again
  * Do I need to mention icomoon somewhere?
  * What about my other css and js?
* Remove JQuery all together at some point. 
* Add a small option to scroll back to top
* I don't like that the header of the blog is quite different to mine...
* Use a mailing library instead of the mail() function. (Like PHPMailer or SwiftMailer)
* Improve the pop-ups of the "send a message" logic
